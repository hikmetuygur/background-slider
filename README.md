- Slider Container Size: The size of the slider container is set using the CSS rules in the style.css file. You can modify the height and width properties of the .slider-container class to adjust the size of the slider.

- Transition Speed: The transition speed between slides can be modified by changing the value of the transition property in the .slider class in the CSS file. Adjust the duration (in seconds) to make the transition faster or slower.

- Arrow Styles: The appearance of the arrow buttons can be customized by modifying the CSS rules for the .arrow class. You can change the background-color, color, padding, font-size, and other properties to match your desired style.

- Font Styles: The project uses the "Roboto" font from Google Fonts. If you prefer a different font, you can update the font-family property in the body rule of the CSS file.

## Dependencies

- Font Awesome: The project uses Font Awesome icons for the arrow buttons. The CSS file includes a link to the Font Awesome stylesheet hosted on a CDN. You can update the version or include it locally if desired.
